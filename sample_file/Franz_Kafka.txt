Franz Kafka
""
"Franz Kafka was a German-speaking Bohemian novelist and short-story writer, widely regarded as one of the major figures of 20th-century literature. His work fuses elements of realism and the fantastic, with protagonists often faced with bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers."
""
"Kafka was born into a middle-class, German-speaking Jewish family in Prague, the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today the capital of the Czech Republic, on July 3, 1883. He trained as a lawyer and, after completing his legal education, obtained employment with an insurance company. He began to write short stories in his spare time."
""
"For the rest of his life, Kafka struggled with a sense of guilt and a lack of self-confidence, which was exacerbated by his strained relationship with his domineering father. These feelings permeate his works, many of which explore themes of alienation, persecution, and the terror of an indifferent or hostile universe."
""
"Kafka's best-known works include ""Die Verwandlung"" (""The Metamorphosis""), Der Process (The Trial), and Das Schloss (The Castle), all of which were published posthumously despite his wish for his manuscripts to be destroyed. Kafka's stories are known for their symbolic representations of modern life in terms of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity."
""
"Kafka's health deteriorated in his late 30s when he developed tuberculosis. He died from complications of the disease on June 3, 1924, at the age of 40. Despite the relatively small body of work he left behind, Kafka has had a profound influence on literature in the century since his death, and he is now considered one of the iconic figures of modern world literature."
""
"Franz Kafka's life was characterized by a deep sense of alienation and loneliness, which was reflected in his work. He never married, although he was engaged twice. His relationships were often fraught with difficulty, a theme that is explored in his letters and diaries."
""
"Kafka's work was largely unrecognized during his lifetime, and he published only a few short stories and never finished any of his full-length novels. He was virtually unknown when he died of tuberculosis in a sanatorium near Vienna in 1924. Before his death, he instructed his friend and literary executor, Max Brod, to destroy all of his manuscripts. However, Brod ignored Kafka's instructions and published most of what was in his possession, thus bringing Kafka's work to the attention of the wider world."
""
"Kafka's writing is characterized by its stark, surreal depictions of psychological conflict and despair. His protagonists are often isolated individuals cursed by a form of destiny they can neither understand nor control. His novels and short stories have been interpreted as being filled with themes and archetypes of alienation, physical and psychological brutality, parentâ€“child conflict, characters on a terrifying quest, and mystical transformations."
""
"Kafka's unique literary style has had a significant influence on a diverse range of writers and artists in the years since his death. His works have become classics of Western literature and have been translated into many languages. The term ""Kafkaesque"" has even entered the English language, referring to situations reminiscent of those in his writing, particularly situations that are illogically complex, bizarre, or nightmarish."
""
"Despite the posthumous fame and influence, Kafka's life was filled with personal struggle and self-doubt. His work, which he once referred to as ""the blend of absurd, surreal and mundane which gave rise to the adjective 'Kafkaesque'"", continues to resonate with readers and writers around the world."
